Innate Consciousness Vessel - Theory Expansion 0.1.1

This is an expansion of 0.1, More of a quick note expansion - Also not reviewed, also has terrible grammar and spelling no doubt - also not a complete thought oops! - go read the initial post for context! 

A larger Consciousness Vessel likely allows you to access portions of your brain that those with a smaller Consciousness Vessel cannot, one thing that an individual with a larger Vessel may be able to do is an ability to control their brain to some degree, what I mean by this is that they have connections in their brain which means that they 
can give themselves access to abilities others cannot, by abilities I am not talking about levitating or predicting the future, I mean that if an individual with a higher
Consciousness Vessel decided one day that they wanted a photographic memory, all it would take is a thought, and potentially time to rewire the necessary parts of their brain in order to allow for this. This ability would likely come from a very high Consciousness Vessel, where it is so high that the individual can rewire the brain in order to accommodate the space necessary to keep expanding their Vessel. This likely occurs as similar to how the Consciousness Vessel exerts a force or a pressure on an individual to seek out knowledge to fill the Consciousness Vessel, this could also be a general combination of things beyond just the Consciousness Vessel and that the Consciousness Vessel is able to take advantage of what is potentially already there in order to fulfil the space it desires to occupy.

When I speak of the Consciousness Vessel as though it has its own will, I do not mean this literally, I mean it in the way that our instincts can exert their will onto us, they are not a separate being but are apart of us
but are still able to control our actions to minor or major degrees and as a result of that control our brains can also change not from direct impacts but as a side effect of them.
